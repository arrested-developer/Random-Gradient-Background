## How to use

You can use this as a blank template to create your page. There are 4 `div`s with absolute position that make the gradient background. You can place your code within the `main` tags.

The background is split into two parts - a header and a main body section. You can use this to hide scrolling content behind the header in order to have a navbar which also changes colour to match the gradient.

In `rgb.js` you can alter the code to use either `getRandomColorHex()` or `getRandomColorFromPalette()`, depending on whether you want completely random gradients, or to use colours from a preset array of hex codes. Change the hex codes in the array to choose your own colour palette.
